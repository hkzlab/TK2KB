## Introduction

I recently built for myself a [TK2000 clone](https://github.com/clemarfolly/Microdigital-TK2000), but I don't have a keyboard to use it so,
before making an expensive mechanical one, I decided to test the design making one with some cheap SMD switches I had around.

## Hardware

The board was designed with [KiCad](https://kicad.org/) EDA.
